    <title>Top 5 MCs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Top 5 MCs</h1>
    <h2>This a "Top 5" list of my favorite MCs of all time</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Black Thought</h3></li>
            <p>This guy is a prolific MC. He is hands down on of the greatest wordsmiths I have ever heard. 
                His carreer with the Roots has been longstanding and filled with memerable songs that I still
                listen to to this day. I first heard him with the Roots after the death of Pac and Big and I had 
                personally lost faith in the Hip-Hop genre, depressed with what the genre had become. Seeing the roots live,
                touring Things Fall Apart, and the fusioin of band music with artistic, conscios lyricism restore my faith
                and brought me back to the genre.
            </p>
        <li><h3>Redman</h3></li>
            <p>What is not to like about Reggie Noble. This guys is not only a prolific wordsmith that produces some
                of the greatest lyricism the genre has ever heard, he is also one of the funniest MCs in the industry.
                There's an expectation of that while his music with have you vibin' his skits will have you lauging
                and this has been true with every album I've heard from him. Couple that with his public persona that 
                makes him very likable, like someone I'd love to just smoke a blunt and riff with. 
            </p>
        <li><h3>Mos Def</h3></li>
            <p>Even though the artist formally known as Mos Def is now know as Yasin Bey, I use his former name mainly 
                because, as Yasin Bey, I have not had access to his work and do not know his catalogue as Bey. I am familiar
                with his catalogue as Mos Def. Black on Both Sides lives in infamy with me as one of the greatest works of
                Hip-Hop artistry I have ever heard. The first time I was introduced to this album I was amazed at unique 
                style, word play, and rhyme scheme. 
            </p>
        <li><h3>Eminem</h3></li>
            <p>Of course a white presenting dude that became an adult in the late 90s would have Slim Shady on his top 5. There is a
                reason that Eminem is refered to as the G.O.A.T... because he is. A lot of people have a lot of opinions
                about this guy but at the end of the day Marshal kept Hip-Hop alive through the turbulent years after the
                death of Tupac and Biggie. He is the greatest wordsmith of all time and continues to produce some of the best
                lyricism hip-hop has ever seen. Anecdotally, while I had stopped listening to new hip-hop for a long time 
                preceeding the years of his release of Kamakazi, it's release encouraged me to revisit some of his catalogue 
                I had over looked. While many people, mainly critics crapped a huge dump on Revival, listening to it in retrospect
                I saw an artist trying to break the mold of how people saw him. To this day I still can't listen to Bad Husband, 
                even the thought of this song evokes painful emotions and this is the true mark of an artist, to move you.
            </p>
        <li><h3>M.F. Doom</h3></li>
            <p>This slot of my top 5 is usually a revolving door of MCs that I'm currently vibing on. It has been filled by
                the likes of KRS1, Rakim, Tupac, Snoop, Jay Z, Ghostface Killah (and other members of the Wu), along with
                MCs outside of the hip-hop genre like Zach De la Rocha and Mike Shinoda, I felt it appropriate to list the 
                late great MF DOOM to round out my top 5. I first heard music by him off his album Operation: Doomsday and 
                was hooked but there is no doubt that his most prolific work was with the producer Mad Libs and there work of
                art Mad Villany, one of the best hip-hop albums of all time. He was one of the greats wordsmiths  
                the industry has ever had the pleasure of hearing. His untimly passing was depressing and sorrowful and his 
                absence leaves a void in the industry that can never be filled.
